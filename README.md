This is a web application that recommends music based on uploaded images. The system uses image analysis and music recommendation models to suggest appropriate songs based on the content of the uploaded images.

## Features

- Image analysis using machine learning models
- Music recommendations based on image content
- Audio preview player for recommended songs

```

2. Apply database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`
